## Code Evaluation System

### Supported Languages
- C (GCC compiler)
- C++ (G++ compiler with C++17 standard)

### Evaluation Process
1. **Compilation**: Code is compiled with appropriate compiler
2. **Execution**: Compiled program runs against test cases
3. **Verdict Assignment**: Based on execution results
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Time and memory usage tracking

### Possible Verdicts
- **AC (Accepted)**: Solution is correct
- **WA (Wrong Answer)**: Output doesn't match expected
- **CE (Compilation Error)**: Code failed to compile
- **RE (Runtime Error)**: Program crashed during execution
- **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)**: Execution took too long
- **MLE (Memory Limit Exceeded)**: Used too much memory
- **PE (Presentation Error)**: Output format issues



## Security Considerations

### Code Execution Safety
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Time and memory limits enforced
- Temporary file cleanup
- Input validation and sanitization

### User Security
- CSRF protection enabled
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Secure password hashing
